									When it comes to Tableau, everyone seems to be satisfied with how-tos. They only seem to ask things like:
									<blockquote>How do I recreate this table I made in PowerPoint?<br>How do I vary the width of each bar on a vertical bar chart?</blockquote>
									It is easy to learn to do things in Tableau. It is much harder to understand why one should.
									<br>Unlike others, we care to know how each design choice could affect the experience of our end users.
									<br><br>
									
									So we would rather ask:
									<blockquote>Should I recreate this table I made in PowerPoint?<br>Should I vary the width of each bar in a vertical bar chart?</blockquote>
